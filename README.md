# Requisition-and-Supply-Management-System
 &middot; [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/your/your-project/blob/master/LICENSE)


The application helps to keep track of all requisitions made within an organization. This was primarily used to keep logs of the stationery and other goods that are used in our college.
This application provided the users with a page where a formal request can be made for additional supplies of stationery and other commodities. The admin can then view all the requests and accept or reject them depending upon the availability of the requested commodity. This project was made to achieve better inventory control.
